# CMS Portfolio

A dynamic, self-built portfolio website powered by **Next.js, TypeScript, and Supabase**.  
This project includes a custom drag-and-drop page builder that allows me to create, edit, and manage content blocks without relying on third-party CMS platforms.

## Features
- Drag-and-drop page builder for managing layout and structure  
- Custom block types: titles, subtitles, images, galleries, slideshows, videos, buttons, and card grids  
- Next.js 14 with TypeScript for a performant and maintainable frontend  
- Supabase backend for authentication, database, and storage  
- TailwindCSS for a clean and responsive design  
- Secure admin panel for editing portfolio content  

## Tech Stack
- **Frontend:** Next.js 14, TypeScript, TailwindCSS  
- **Backend:** Supabase (Postgres, Auth, Storage)  
- **Deployment:** Vercel  
- **UI Components:** shadcn/ui  

## Future Plans
- Add versioning and history for content edits  
- Expand block types (Markdown, Timeline, Blog posts)  
- Improve animations and transitions between blocks  
- Build a reusable template system for layouts
